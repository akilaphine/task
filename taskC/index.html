                <p>In smaller organizations, the manager or owner is likely performing the HRM
                        functions.They hire people, train them, and determine how much they should be
                        paid. Larger companies ultimately perform the same tasks, but because they have
                        more employees, they can afford to employ specialists, or human resource managers,
                        to handle these areas of the business. As a result, it is highly likely that you, as a
                        manager or entrepreneur, will be performing HRM tasks, hence the value in
                        understanding the strategic components of HRM.</p>
