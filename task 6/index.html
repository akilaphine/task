        <h3>Experience so far</h3>
<p> The training was awesome and so far i was able to learn the basic command of how to create directory,how to create repository, git add, commit and git push. Also i learn how to create a table, how to write letter using html. I also learn how to create a link and form so far. I also want to thank the management for putting things like this in place, also i want to appreciate my tutor for his patience despite my slow learn he still lead me through upto this time, i want to say thank you all.

    <h3>Suggession</h3>
    I want to appeal to the management that the should atleast consider the time frame, maybe the should extend it beyond a month inorder to enable slow learners also to partake into this great opportunity. Paritie Innovation Hub you are the best.
